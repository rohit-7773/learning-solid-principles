# Learning SOLID Principles
SOLID priciples are some kind of design patterns introduced by Robert Martin (uncle bob). Their main purposes is to make your code :- 
1. Maintainable
2. Readable
3. Extensible


------------


 #### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
>  **Every thing has its own place and everything should be placed in its own place. In simple words, a class should  have one and only one reason to change.**


#### 2. Open-Closed Principle
> ***An entity should be open for extension and closed for modification. In simple words, able to extends the functionality by adding new code instead of changing the existing one.***


#### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle
> ***If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program***
